# PDF Key Value Extractor

## Background
This project was developed to meet the requirements of a potential client seeking a solution to extract key values from standard PDFs. As a MERN stack developer, I created this project to showcase my skills and expertise.

## Project Overview
The PDF Key Value Extractor is a web application built using React and Node.js. It allows users to upload standard PDF files, extract specific key values, and present them directly on the frontend.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** Extracts text content from uploaded PDF files.
- **Key Value Extraction:** Parses the text to identify and extract specified key values.
- **Simple UI:** Provides an intuitive interface for PDF upload and viewing extracted key values.

## Demo
A live demo of the PDF Key Value Extractor can be found [here](https://pdf-text-extractor-ozgq.onrender.com/).
